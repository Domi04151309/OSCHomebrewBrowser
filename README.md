# Homebrew Browser Lite

Browse Homebrew Apps on your Wii.
This app is based on the original Homebrew Browser and adjusted to work with the OpenShopChannel API.
It includes a graphical overhaul and simplifies the original code.

## Building

To build this app you need `DevKitPro` installed.
With `DevKitPro` you can then build `GRRLIB` from source so that you can finally build this app.

## Useful Commands
- `make clean` Cleans up
- `make -j` Builds the app

## Planned
- Storing indexes in homebrew lists instead of duplicated data
- No duplicated data lists
- Dynamically drawn dialogs
- Better sorting (quick sort)
- Less repetitive code (more functions)
- Migration to C++ (?)
